#wpm

wpm is a simple Speed Typing Test script implemented in Python using the curses library. It allows users to test their typing speed by typing out a randomly selected line from a text file and calculates their words per minute (WPM) and accuracy.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- curses library (for terminal UI)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the script.
2. Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
3. Run the script in your terminal:

```python speed_typing_test.py```

4. Follow the on-screen instructions:
   - Press any key to begin the test.
   - Type out the displayed text as accurately and quickly as possible.
   - Once you've completed typing the text, press any key to continue to the next test or exit the program by pressing the Escape key (ESC).

## Note

This version has a bug assosciated with the handling of the backspace key while typing.
